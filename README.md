Backend developer 

## Coding experience
I am a newly graduated student - ICT Engineer / Data Engineer. I have around 1 and a half years experience on working with Java. From the position of Student Worker and in the period of my internship I succeeded to fulfill different tasks including bug fixing, testing and developing new features in both backend and frontend. Beside work experience, I have gained knowledge on databases and business intelligence tools during my studies. 

## Technical choices

The project was made using JAVA. Several classes were creaded in order to fulfil the requirements with main focus on Feature and Project objects. A project has an id, a generated unique key, a name, a created date, a last updated date and a list of feature flags. A feature has an project id, a name and of course a status (enabled/disabled). Several paths were created in order to communicate with the server serving operations such as: GET - getProjects, getProjectFeatureFlag, POST - createProject, createFeatureFlag, DELETE - removeFeatureFlag.  Beside rest APIs and the other methods implementations, I have created a class DBdata with operations used to access and store the data. The connection with a relational database was not created for the moment, but I am sure all the CRUD operations will work as defined.  I have also imagined how the user hsould interact with the system, therfore I have done a static HTML page.

## Delimiations

Due to the lack of time and less advanced experience, the implementation is not ready for comercial purposes yet. The UI ws made just to show the flow of the system and it is not connected with the backend. I would have been nice to use AngularJS,NodeJS,ReactJS in order to do that.
